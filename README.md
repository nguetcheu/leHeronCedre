A basic spring mvc/hibernate project, side project for my own interests and practice

I wanted to review the basics of Spring MVC and Hibernate, what better way then to make CRUD MVC application!

I just did this to go over spring's mvc configurations and how a spring application was done before spring boot. I linked this application to a MYSQL database and used the Hibernate framework to make my life easy, Hibernate allows me to query the databse for my mapped objects much easier then a normal standard jdbc connection, not to mention i wont have to keep repeating the jdbc code.

add in lib directory 
hibernate-release-5.2.0.Final jar file

javax.servlet.jsp.jstl-1.2.1 jar file

javax.servlet.jsp.jstl-api-1.2.1 jar file

spring-5.3.9-dist jar file
